# ADV v2.0 — AXIOM Deviation Framework

## Status
Version: 2.0  
Scope: Conceptual / Analytical Framework  
Dependency: AXIOM Core Reference Model  
Normative Force: None

---

## 1. Purpose

ADV (AXIOM Deviation Vector) is a structured classification framework for describing how real-world settlement systems deviate from AXIOM along explicit assumption axes.

ADV is not a protocol, standard, certification, metric, or enforcement mechanism.  
It is a **language for disciplined comparison**.

---

## 2. Relationship to AXIOM

AXIOM defines a hypothetical settlement system with maximal invariance and minimal assumptions.

ADV exists **only relative to AXIOM**.

Formally:AXIOM is the fixed reference point.  
ADV measures **deviation from that reference**, not “absolute quality” or “truth”.

By definition:This zero denotes **zero deviation**, not “zero assumptions”.

---

## 3. Nature of the Framework

ADV is a **classification system**, not a measurement system.

It uses vector-like notation for clarity and intuition, but it is **not**:
- A metric space
- A vector space
- A normed space
- A predictive model

ADV is best understood as:
- A labeled tuple of ordinal dimensions
- A partial order over systems
- A structured taxonomy of design commitments

Mathematical notation is used **metaphorically** where it exceeds ordinal classification.

---

## 4. Dimensions

Each ADV dimension represents a distinct class of assumptions introduced relative to AXIOM.

Examples (non-exhaustive):
- Consensus modification
- Governance discretion
- External coordination
- Oracle dependence
- Mutability / upgradability
- Trust delegation
- Social override mechanisms

Each dimension is **independent and explicit**.

Dimensions may be extended in future versions without altering the AXIOM core.

---

## 5. Ordinality and Comparison

Values within each dimension are **ordinal**, not cardinal.

This means:
- Ordering is meaningful
- Arithmetic subtraction is not strictly defined
- Cross-dimensional comparison is not intrinsic

Any notion of “distance”, “magnitude”, or “ΔADV” is a **heuristic projection** used for human reasoning, not a formal metric.

---

## 6. Identity and Temporal Evolution

ADV does not preserve system identity across structural changes by default.

If a system removes or fundamentally alters assumptions:
- The prior system is considered ended
- A new system instance is evaluated

This prevents:
- Identity laundering
- Historical narrative override
- “We are still the same system” ambiguity

Continuity is a social claim, not an ADV axiom.

---

## 7. Declaration vs Verification

ADV is a **declarative language**, not a detector.

If a system misrepresents its assumptions:
- ADV has not failed
- The declaration has failed

ADV provides the form.  
Communities provide verification.

This mirrors:
- Threat models in security research
- Taxonomies in science
- Type systems in programming

---

## 8. Canonical Reference and Alternatives

AXIOM is the reference point **by construction**, not by discovery.

Alternative AXIOM-like references could exist, yielding alternative ADV frameworks:This does not invalidate ADV; it contextualizes it.

The current framework commits explicitly to AXIOM v1.2 as its origin.

---

## 9. What ADV Is Not

ADV must not be used as:
- A ranking system
- An investment signal
- A security certification
- A governance legitimacy test
- A regulatory compliance claim

ADV does not judge merit.  
It exposes structure.

---

## 10. Epistemic Position

ADV occupies a middle ground:

More formal than:
- Natural language discourse
- Marketing narratives

Less formal than:
- Mathematical proof systems
- Physical measurement

Comparable to:
- Legal reasoning frameworks
- Biological taxonomies
- Type systems
- Capability matrices

ADV is unfalsifiable in the empirical sense, but evaluable for:
- Internal consistency
- Expressive adequacy
- Stability under critique
- Practical usefulness

---

## 11. Central Commitment

ADV exists to enable **clear, honest, and disciplined discussion** of settlement system design tradeoffs.

It does not discover truth.  
It does not predict outcomes.  
It does not enforce values.

It structures conversation.

## Appendix A — Canonical Deviation Axes (ADV v2.0)

The following deviation axes (D1–D10) provide a structured, non-normative
language for describing how real-world settlement systems deviate from the
AXIOM reference model.

These axes are **descriptive, not prescriptive**.
They do not imply correctness, desirability, or optimization.

### D1 — Governance Injection
Degree to which rule changes or outcomes depend on human or institutional governance.

### D2 — Discretionary Control
Presence of discretionary authority over state transitions or enforcement.

### D3 — External Oracle Dependence
Reliance on off-system data sources or authorities for correctness.

### D4 — Rule Mutability
Ability for core rules to be altered post-genesis.

### D5 — Settlement Finality Ambiguity
Lack of deterministic or irreversible settlement guarantees.

### D6 — Trust Assumptions
Dependence on trusted actors, committees, or social coordination.

### D7 — Social Override Layer
Existence of social, legal, or political mechanisms that can override system outcomes.

### D8 — Temporal Inconsistency
Inconsistency of rules or outcomes across time or states.

### D9 — Enforcement Asymmetry
Unequal enforcement of rules across participants or classes.

### D10 — Interpretive Ambiguity
Degree to which system behavior requires interpretation rather than verification.

**Note:**  
This list is intentionally non-exhaustive. Additional axes may be appended in
future ADV versions without modifying AXIOM.
