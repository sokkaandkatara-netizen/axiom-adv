# AXIOM — Core Reference Model

Status: Canonical Reference  
Version: 1.0  
Normative Force: None  
Scope: Hypothetical Settlement Systems

## Definition

AXIOM defines a hypothetical settlement system with maximal invariance and minimal assumptions.

It exists solely as a reference point for comparison.
It is not intended to be implemented, governed, optimized, or adapted.

## Core Axioms

A1. All rules are fully specified at genesis and never change.

A2. No governance, discretion, or social process exists.

A3. All state transitions are deterministic and verifiable using protocol-internal data alone.

A4. No oracle, external coordination, or off-system authority is required.

A5. The system is indifferent to adoption, usability, efficiency, price, or social relevance.

## Boundary

Any system that violates, relaxes, or supplements these axioms is not AXIOM.

Such systems may only be described relative to AXIOM via deviation frameworks.
