# AXIOM–ADV Reference Framework

**AXIOM** is an axiomatic reference model for invariant settlement systems.  
**ADV (AXIOM Distance Vector)** is a structured classification framework for describing how real-world systems deviate from AXIOM along explicit assumption axes.

This repository defines **a reference point and a language**, not a deployable protocol, standard, or product.

## 1. What AXIOM Is

AXIOM is a **pure reference model**.

It defines a hypothetical settlement system that is:
- Fully rule-frozen after genesis
- Free of governance, discretion, oracles, and external coordination
- Anchored only in protocol-internal cost, cryptographic verification, and deterministic rules
- Explicitly indifferent to adoption, liveness, usability, price, or social relevance

AXIOM is **not intended to be deployed**.

Its purpose is to answer a single question:

> *What does a maximally invariant settlement core look like if we remove every assumption that requires human or institutional discretion?*

AXIOM serves the same role that:
- Turing Machines serve for computation, or
- Absolute zero serves in thermodynamics

It is a **limit point**, not an engineering blueprint.

## 2. What AXIOM Is Not

AXIOM is **not**:
- A cryptocurrency
- A protocol specification
- A governance proposal
- A performance-optimized system
- A claim about what *should* be built

AXIOM makes **no promises** about:
- Liveness
- Fairness
- Efficiency
- Incentives
- Adoption
- Security in the real world

All security statements are **conditional** on explicit assumptions.

## 3. What ADV Is

ADV (AXIOM Distance Vector) is a **classification framework** that describes how a given settlement system departs from AXIOM.

ADV represents systems as **ordinal vectors** across explicitly defined dimensions (e.g. governance, liveness guarantees, cryptographic adaptivity, semantic complexity).

ADV answers questions like:
- *Which assumptions does this system introduce?*
- *In which directions does it move away from invariance?*
- *How do two systems differ in their design commitments?*

ADV is **descriptive**, not evaluative.

---

## 4. What ADV Is Not

ADV is **not**:
- A ranking system
- A compliance standard
- A certification scheme
- A security score
- An investment metric
- An objective measure of quality or superiority

ADV does **not** claim:
- That smaller distance is “better”
- That systems closer to AXIOM are preferable
- That scalar distance has intrinsic meaning

Any scalar distance, norm, or aggregation is **interpretive and optional**, not normative.

---

## 5. Relationship Between AXIOM and ADV

AXIOM and ADV are intentionally asymmetric:

- **AXIOM is definitional**
- **ADV is referential**

AXIOM does not depend on ADV.  
ADV has **no independent semantics** without AXIOM as its origin.
